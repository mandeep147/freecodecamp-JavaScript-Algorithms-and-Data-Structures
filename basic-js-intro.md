**Basics of JavaScript**    
  
**push**: to append data at the end of the array    
**pop**: removes last element from array    
**shift**: removes first element from array    
**unshift**: to append data at the beginning of the array    

**scope** refers to the visibility of variables.    
 1. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope.
    This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code
 2. Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope.
    the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
